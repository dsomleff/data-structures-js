# DFS & BFS Searches

### DFS
- Depth First Search - Going to the end of the tree to the higher height (all the way to the left until no 
children node would have). As deep as possible , so that's why it's a DFS. 
- It works like a stack structure.
- Save the shape of a tree

### BFS
- Breadth First Search - Going on each of the level of a tree.
- It works like a queue structure.
- NOT save the shape of a tree.
