# DFS & BFS Searches

- Depth First Search (DFS) - Going to the end of the tree to the higher height (all the way to the left until no 
children node would have). As deep as possible , so that's why it's a DFS. It works like a stack structure.
- Breadth First Search (BFS) - Going on each of the level of a tree. It works like a queue structure.
