# Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in JS

All code was created during the watching ['Data Structures & Algorithms - JavaScript
](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-javascript/) and 
['coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure-journey'](https://www.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/)

Basically, there are two types of data structures :
1. Linear Data Structure — Array, Queue, Stack, Linked List, etc…
2. Non-linear Data Structure — Trees, Graphs, etc…
