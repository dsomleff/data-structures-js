# Usage of Stack

### Examples of stacks in "real life":
 - The stack of trays in a cafeteria
- A stack of plates in a cupboard
 - A driveway that is only one car wide

### Examples of stacks in computing:
- Back/Forward stacks on browsers
- Undo/Redo functionality
- Our code editor uses a stack to check if we have closed all our parentheses properly
- Suppose we are coding a chess-playing algorithm and at a certain point, the algorithm finds that a set of steps fails to win. In this situation, the algorithm will reverse back to the safe state and try another possible set of steps
-  It is a common question during interviews to write a program to check if the parenthesis is balanced or not.
- We use the stack data structure to check unbalanced parenthesis by pushing open brackets into the stack and pop out 
after a closing bracket. If nothing lasts at the end then all parenthesis are matched.
